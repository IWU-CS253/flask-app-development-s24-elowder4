# Flask Example

An example Flask application (adapted from the [Flask 0.12 tutorial](https://www.iwu.edu/~mliffito/flask_tutorial/))
Ethan Lowder has modified the original application code to add additional features like rebranding to Flaskr Plus, adding catagories to posts, filter posts, and delete individual posts.
